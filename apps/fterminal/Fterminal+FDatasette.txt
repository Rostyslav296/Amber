# The F-Stack: Agentic Intelligence Platform
**Version:** 1.0 (Genesis) | **Architecture:** Brain-Bucket-Monitor

## 🏴 The Manifesto
Standard AI Agents are blind and paralyzed. They can write text, but they cannot *see* the world or *remember* complex states.

**The F-Stack** changes this. It is a "Super App" ecosystem that gives an AI Agent (like Amber) a complete OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act).
1.  **FTerminal:** The Hands. (Execution & Action)
2.  **FDatasette:** The Eyes & Memory. (Visualization & Recall)
3.  **The Bridge:** The Nervous System. (Real-time IPC)

## 🏗 The Architecture: A Cybernetic Loop

This system is not a linear script; it is a **circular feedback loop**.

🧠 Core Components

1. FTerminal (The Executor)

Role: The runtime environment where the Agent wields tools.

Capability: It doesn't just "run code." It runs Self-Healing Agents.

Auto-Dependency: "Missing library? I'll install it."

Auto-Permission: "Permission denied? I'll pause and wait for the user."

Philosophy: "Fire and Forget." The terminal captures the data, saves it to the Bucket, and moves on. It never worries about how to display it.

2. FDatasette (The Monitor)

Role: The high-performance, reactive visualization engine.

Capability: It transforms raw SQL data into "Executive Intelligence."

NSA-Style Dashboards: Dark mode, high-contrast metrics.

Dynamic Manuals: Context-aware documentation that loads on demand.

Live Updates: Refreshes instantly when the Terminal finishes a task.

Philosophy: "Data is Useless without Context." It turns rows of numbers into Heatmaps, Intel Reports, and Graphs.

⚡ Workflows: The Infinite Toolset
Because the architecture is decoupled, you can build any tool in minutes without changing the platform code.

📡 Workflow A: SIGINT (Signals Intelligence)

The Tool: scan-bluetooth-devices.py

The Action: Agent scans local radio frequencies.

The Intelligence:

Raw: RSSI -48, OUI: 4C:20:..

FDatasette View: "CRITICAL CONTACT: Apple iPhone detected < 1ft away."

Use Case: Security auditing, lost device recovery, occupancy detection.

🌐 Workflow B: Cyber Recon (Planned)

The Tool: scan-wifi-networks.py

The Action: Agent puts the Wi-Fi card into monitor mode.

The Intelligence:

Raw: SSID "Hidden", Chan 6, Enc: WPA2.

FDatasette View: Map of all unauthorized access points in your building.

💾 Workflow C: The Second Brain (Planned)

The Tool: index-local-knowledge.py

The Action: Agent recursively reads your ~/Documents folder.

The Intelligence:

Raw: notes.txt, budget.xls.

FDatasette View: A searchable, full-text index of your entire digital life. "Amber, show me every file where I mentioned 'Project X'."

🛠 Ingenuity of Design
1. The "Unix Philosophy"

Most "Agent Apps" try to be one giant, bloated EXE file. The F-Stack is a collection of tiny, sharp tools.

The Scanner doesn't know how to draw a UI.

The UI doesn't know how to scan Bluetooth.

Result: You can upgrade the UI to a web server, or swap the Scanner for a C++ binary, and the system keeps working.

2. The "Intel Officer" Logic

We don't just dump data. We generate Derived Intelligence.

Bad AI: "Here is a list of 50 numbers."

F-Stack: "I analyzed the 50 numbers. 49 are noise. 1 is a threat. Here is the threat."

This is achieved via SQL Views and Post-Processing Logic inside the tools.

3. The "Zero-Config" Bridge

The system uses a Universal Link Script (datasette_fterminal_link.py).

Any script, in any language, just needs to write a JSON packet to /tmp/fdatasette_sock.ipc.

The Dashboard instantly obeys.

No API keys, no cloud servers, no latency.

🔮 The Future
You have built the Operating System for your Agent. Today, it sees Bluetooth. Tomorrow, it manages your finances, monitors your server uptime, and organizes your research.

Welcome to the F-Stack.
